Computer aided drug design (CADD) is a multidisciplinary field attracting the researchers from in-
formation technology, medicine, pharmacology etc. to discover new tools and techniques or enhance
the available tools and techniques to assist in drug discovery process. These techniques proved to
be effective in various stages of drug discovery process thus reducing both cost and time taken for
developing a drug than conventional methods. Various CADD tools are used that assist during the
process of drug development.Various machine learning processes are being used in present days for
drug prediction.
This repository contains code developed for classification of active and inactive drug molecules using Artificial Neural Network.
